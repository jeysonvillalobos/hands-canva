# 🖐️ hands-canva

**hands-canva** is an interactive web application that lets you **draw in the air using your hands** through your device's camera — no mouse, stylus, or touchscreen required.

Using real-time hand tracking powered by **MediaPipe**, you can change colors, erase the canvas, and adjust brush thickness — all with hand gestures.

- The app accesses your webcam and detects your hand in real time.
