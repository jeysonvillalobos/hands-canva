# 🖐️ hands-canva

**hands-canva** is an interactive web application that lets you **draw in the air using your hands** through your device's camera — no mouse, stylus, or touchscreen required.

Using real-time hand tracking powered by **MediaPipe**, you can change colors and erase the canvas — all with hand gestures.

## 📸 How It Works

- The app accesses your webcam and detects your hand in real time.
- **Pinching your index and thumb** draws on the canvas.
- Hovering your index finger over the on-screen tools allows you to:
  - Change color
  - Clear the entire canvas
